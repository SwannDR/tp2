Name two advantages of PaaS over IaaS?
  Paas requires less time and skills to manage, thus accelerating the development and deployment of new applications. 

# 2.
What is the difference between PaaS and Serverless?
  Serverless is based on a pay per use system. The user only has to pay for the requests he makes or the execution time, whereas with PaaS you pay a constant price no     matter how much you use the service.

# 3.
What does Serverless mean?
  It is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers.

# 4.
What are the three desirable properties of Serverless?
-  reduced cost because you only pay for the resources we use. 
-  high availability of resources by adjusting the allocation of resources according to the applications.
-  freedom it offers to the developer who can focus on development and not on infrastructure maintenance. 

# 5.
What is the name of the smallest deployable compute unit in Serverless?
A Pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster. Pods contain one or more containers, such as Docker containers. When a Pod runs multiple containers, the containers are managed as a single entity and share the Pod's resources.
